</head>
<body bgcolor="#cccccc" text="#000000">
<h1>Overview of the Eiffel Loop libraries</h1>
<h3>Audio management</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Native Eiffel module to read and write wav audio file headers and
data.</li>
  <li>Eiffel interface to the eyeD3 Python library for reading and
writing ID3 audio tags.</li>
  <li>Unified Eiffel interface to both the libid3tag (C) and libid3
(C++) for reading and
writing ID3 audio tags. </li>
</ul>
<h3>Digital Signal Processing</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Eiffel interface to the Windows sound input API&nbsp; allowing
streaming audio&nbsp;from the microphone to be processed in Eiffel
using
classes from the producer-consumer thread library. Implemented as a WEL
extension.</li>
  <li>Eiffel framework for buffering audio data into the Windows audio
output API. Can be used to create audio synthesizers.<br>
  </li>
  <li>Eiffel interface to the Praat sound analysis engine and script
interpreter. Praat is an open source tool used by linguists for
analyzing speech. The interface allows Praat scripts to be run from
Eiffel and
the resulting values of script variables to be retrieved.&nbsp;<br>
  </li>
  <li>Eiffel/ActionScript 2.0 framework for building applications that
analyze microphone input in real-time in the Praat speech analysis
engine and visually representing the&nbsp;results in Macromedia Flash.
The
microphone status is presented in an Eiffel GUI as an overlay to a
Flash presentation. Synchronized opening and closing of Flash/Eiffel
applications gives the illusion of a single application. </li>
</ul>
<h3>Multi-threading</h3>
<ul>
  <li>A generic producer-consumer thread communication framework where
a producing thread places products onto a queue for consumption by a
consumer thread. <br>
  </li>
  <dl>
    <dt>Features:<br>
    </dt>
  </dl>
  <ul>
    <li>Implementation of a single consumer thread consuming
the products of a single worker thread.</li>
    <li>Implementation of multiple consumer threads
consuming
the products of a single worker thread.</li>
    <li>Vision2 extension allowing products of a thread to be consumed
by the main GUI application thread.</li>
    <li>Specialized consumer-producer thread classes for agent action
consuming.</li>
  </ul>
  <li>A Vision2 extension framework for building proxy interfaces to
GUI components that are callable from non-GUI threads. Allows non-GUI
threads to asynchronously call routines that call Vision2
routines.</li>
  <li>Intermittent timed event framework</li>
  <li>Specialized "action loop" thread classes with a number of
variations:</li>
  <ul>
    <li>Intermittently repeat an action with a specified sleep interval
until signaled to stop.</li>
    <li>Continuously repeat an action until signaled to stop.</li>
    <li>Continuously repeat an action until receiving a signal to
suspend or exit. Remains suspended unless signaled to resume or exit.<br>
    </li>
  </ul>
  <li>A generic synchronization monitor allowing synchronization on
an object to be protected with a contract requiring that the object is
locked before being referenced. It is integrated with the logging
framework to help detect deadlock conditions. If a thread needs to wait
for a lock on a synchronized object, both the waiting and acquiring of
the lock is logged in the thread's log.</li>
  <li>Container cell class for numeric types shared across threads.
Features thread safe increment, decrement, add and subtract operations.</li>
  <li>Thread safe queue and stack container classes.<br>
  </li>
</ul>
<h3>Logging</h3>
<p>Logging framework with the following features:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Output is indented to reflect the state of the call stack. Shows
the entry and exit from routines in a way that is designed to mimic the
routines code definition. </li>
  <li>Global filtering mechanism to restrict output to selected classes
and routines. A wildcard character can be used to log all routines for
a
particular class.</li>
  <li>Integrated with UI component to switch thread context visible in
console. <br>
  </li>
  <ul>
    <li>Features:</li>
  </ul>
  <ul>
    <li>Support for both Vision2 and WEL GUI toolkits.</li>
    <li>Thread contexts selectable from a dialog
drop down list</li>
    <li>Thread selection history navigation buttons with browser style
ALT
left/right arrow keyboard shortcuts </li>
  </ul>
</ul>
<h3>Client-server network</h3>
<ul>
  <li><b><a href="http://www.eiffel-loop.com/eros.html">EROS</a>,</b>
an XML orientated remote procedure call application
framework with an
original protocol based purely on XML processing instructions rather
that any special XML tags. <br>
  </li>
  <dl>
    <dt>Features:</dt>
  </dl>
  <ul>
    <li>Easily create multi threaded XML-RPC applications in Eiffel. </li>
    <li>Allows standard XML documents (SVG, XHTML etc) to be turned
into procedure calls with the addition of a single processing
instruction.</li>
    <li>Based on framework that allows flexible mapping of XML data to
native Eiffel objects. Represent your XML data in Eiffel any way you
want. Skim off as little or as much data from the document as you need.
Much more efficient than DOM based approach.</li>
    <li>Deserialization (XML-&gt;Eiffel) uses declarative xpath to
setter mapping arrays. Multi context mapping greatly simplifies
deserialization of complex documents and eliminating the need for very
long absolute XPaths. Instead define a number of XML contexts with
shorter relative xpaths.</li>
    <li>Serialization (Eiffel-&gt;XML) uses Evolicity the Eiffel Loop
templating mini language (Similar to Apache Velocity). Evolicity
supports multi context serialization to simplify serialization of
complex Eiffel structures.</li>
    <li>Develop your remotely accessible application components on
single threaded console test harness and deploy on multi-threaded
server with thread output and performance monitor. </li>
    <li>Demo application to calculate Fourier transformations based on
Greg Lee's Numeric Eiffel Library.</li>
    <li>Server GUI to control startup/shutdown and thread log output
context switching in command console. Easily see whats happening with a
large number of threads with browser like navigation controls.</li>
    <li>Server GUI monitors 11 different performance characteristics. </li>
  </ul>
  <li>Eiffel/Flash ActionScript framework allowing Eiffel to make
asynchronous calls to ActionScript procedures in a Flash application
using simple XML messages. Also allows Flash button clicks to be
actioned in Eiffel application.</li>
  <li>Extension to Eiffel Software FTP_PROTOCOL class making it easy to
upload files, create remote directories and perform other common FTP
operations. </li>

    <li>Collection of patterns to search for XML code fragments.</li>
  </ul>
  <li>A framework for creating automated text file editors operating on
directory source trees. Based on the Eiffel Loop parsing and lexing
library, it is able find and replace complex patterns with equally
complex editions. It is both simpler and more powerful than the Unix
sed utility. Programs are more readable than Perl scripts and equally
powerful. Suited to creating tools for migrating a source tree to a
different platform or compiler. If a new version of the source tree
comes a long the migration tool you created for the previous version
will probably still work.<br>
  </li>
  <li><i><b>Evolicity</b>,</i> an Eiffelized version of the <a
 href="http://velocity.apache.org/">Apache
Velocity</a> text substitution scripting language allowing Eiffel data
to
be easily interpolated into plain text. Evolicity was created using the
Eiffel Loop parsing and lexing framework.<br>
  </li>
</ul>
<h3>XML processing</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Eiffel
interface to the <a href="http://vtd-xml.sourceforge.net/">VTD-XML</a>
XML parser. VTD-XML is arguably the world's <a
 href="http://ximpleware.wordpress.com/2009/08/">top performing XML
parser</a> and xpath 1.0 implementation both in terms of speed and
memory efficiency. The
Eiffel interface actually represents an improvement over the original C
and Java API. It supports nested
xpath queries and is much more developer friendly requiring fewer
objects to manage.</li>
  <li>Eiffel
interface to the <a href="http://expat.sourceforge.net/">Expat XML
parser</a> that is significantly faster than the GOBO parser.</li>
  <li>High performance XPath event processor based on declarative
mapping of xpaths to Eiffel agents using a minimal subset of xpath
query language.</li>
  <li>An XML deserialization framework based on declarative mapping of
relative xpaths to Eiffel builder agents. A builder agent is a routine
that constructs some part of an Eiffel object. <br>
  </li>
  <dl>
    <dt>Key features: <br>
    </dt>
  </dl>
  <ul>
    <li>Ability to define many mapping contexts for a single document.
All Xpaths defined within a context are relative to a parent context.</li>
    <li>Allows flexible mapping of XML documents to Eiffel models
composed of an arbitrary number of classes.</li>
    <li>Supports recursive data models.</li>
    <li>Uses a small subset of the xpath query language.</li>
    <li>Supports xpath mapping based on attribute value predicates,
i.e. Expressions of the form AAA/BBB[@x='y'] may be used to map
building agents.</li>
  </ul>
  <li>A framework for serializing Eiffel objects as XML based on the
Eiffel Loop text substitution scripting language, Evolicity.</li>
  <li>A DOM like mini framework for modeling XML in Eiffel.</li>
  <li>A parser for an alternate "Pythonized" XML syntax called Pyxis
(Acronym
for <b>PY</b>thonic <b>X</b>ml <b>I</b>deal <b>S</b>ource). The
goal is to have a
more readable
text for XML configuration files.&nbsp;<br>
  </li>
</ul>
<h3>External Language integration</h3>
<ul>
  <li>An advanced framework for wrapping Java classes that adds a layer
of abstraction to Eiffel Software's Java2Eiffel library. It is based on
the concept of a Java agent in Eiffel (<i>JAVA_FUNCTION</i> or <i>JAVA_PROCEDURE</i>
inheriting <i>JAVA_ROUTINE</i>) that is analogous to an Eiffel agent. <i>JAVA_ROUTINE's</i>
automatically generate correct JNI call signatures. Allows the creation
of recursively wrapped classes where the arguments and return types to
wrapped routines are themselves wrapped classes.</li>
  <li>An extension to the <a
 href="http://eiffel.seibostudios.se/export/124/pepe/trunk/doc/pepe.pdf">PEPE
framework</a> for wrapping Python libraries that automates the process
of converting Eiffel types to Python types and vice-versa.</li>
  <li>A framework for calling Matlab scripts and Matlab scripts that
have been compiled into C, and processing the results in Eiffel.</li>
  <li>A framework for running Praat speech analysis scripts in Eiffel
and processing the results.</li>
  <li>Container library for sharing data with C/C++ programs including:</li>
  <ul>
    <li>C strings covering all permutations of little and big endian 8,
16 and 32 bit characters.</li>
    <li>Wrapper for C numeric arrays.<br>
    </li>
  </ul>
</ul>
<h3>Math</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Basic column and row vector implementation<br>
  </li>
</ul>
<h3>Structures</h3>
<ul>
  <li>An extension to the standard Elks <i>ARRAY </i>class that
allows memory area sharing on sub arrays. Possible to see up to a 100%
performance increase on digital processing applications which make
heavy use of ARRAYs. (Standard Elks subarray function makes a copy of
the subarray. Safe but not very efficient.) </li>
  <li>Memory efficient form of numeric lists with many repeats
implemented as run length encoded arrayed lists.</li>
  <li>Numeric array serialization.<br>
  </li>
</ul>
<h3>OS interaction</h3>

moving, copying and deleting.</li>
    <li>File moving,
copying and deleting.</li>
  </ul>
  <li>A
command string variable substitution component<br>
  </li>
</ul>
<h3>Tools</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Automatic code editor that operates on the gcc source code
tree of the Praat linguistics tool. The editor adds hooks for an Eiffel

<p>A collection of Python scripts to aid Eiffel builds including:</p>
<ul>
  <li>A script to manage OS environments from a project Python script
and launch EiffelStudio. </li>
  <li>An extension to scons build system for Eiffel projects with the
following features:</li>
  <ul>
    <li>Select freeze or finalize build</li>
    <li>Builds any Eiffel library precompiles using a standard
SConstruct<br>
    </li>
    <li>Checks for existence of SConstruct to build C dependencies</li>
