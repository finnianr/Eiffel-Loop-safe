This class makes available all of the numeric functions provided in the standard C run-time library from <math.h>.

It also implements "safe" versions of some trigonometric functions. With numerical computation noise, is is not uncommon, for example, to attempt to take the arc sine of a number just greater than one. The "safe" arc sine will truncate this argument to one and not trigger a domain error. However, blindly using the safe trig functions without understanding the numeric precision issues with your software will inevitably lead to false results. Use them with caution.
