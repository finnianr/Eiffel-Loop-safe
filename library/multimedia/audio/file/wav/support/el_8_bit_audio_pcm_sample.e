note
	description: "[
		
		8-bit PCM data contained in WAV files is usually stored as
		unsigned numbers, whereas the LM4549 codec (and most 16-bit WAV files) work with signed
		quantities. Attempting to play unsigned samples directly will produce a horribly distorted
		waveform. Thus, when playing unsigned sample data, an offset which corresponds to the mid-point 
		value must be deducted from each sample value. For 8-bit unsigned values, this offset is 0x7F
		
		NOTES: not tested but should work
