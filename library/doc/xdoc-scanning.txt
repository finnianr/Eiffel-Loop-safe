**XML Node Scanning**

The 5 parse event generators types, all descendants of class [$source EL_PARSE_EVENT_SOURCE], are as follows:

**1.** [$source EL_EXPAT_XML_PARSER]: An Eiffel binding to the [http://expat.sourceforge.net/ eXpat XML parser]

**2.** [$source EL_EXPAT_XML_PARSER_OUTPUT_MEDIUM]: [http://expat.sourceforge.net/ eXpat XML parser] of XML serializeable objects conforming to
`EVOLICITY_SERIALIZEABLE_AS_XML'.

**3.** [$source EL_EXPAT_XML_WITH_CTRL_Z_PARSER]: [http://expat.sourceforge.net/ eXpat XML parser] with input stream end delimited
by Ctrl-Z character. Useful for parsing network streams.

**4.** [$source EL_BINARY_ENCODED_XML_PARSE_EVENT_SOURCE]: a binary encoded XML event source. Useful for reducing the size of large documents.

**5.** [$source EL_PYXIS_PARSER] event from a [https://www.eiffel.org/node/143 Pyxis format] parser. Pyxis is a direct analog of XML that is
easier to read and edit making it suitable for configuration files.


The following are the various kinds of scanners which can process the output from these event sources.

**Eiffel Object Building Scanners**

The classes [$source EL_BUILDABLE_FROM_XML] and [$source EL_BUILDABLE_FROM_PYXIS] can be used to implement a sophisticated Eiffel object building scheme based on the idea of mapping builder agents to xpaths relative to particular element contexts. Only a small subset of the xpath standard is used. The framework has the following features:

* Map particular XML element contexts to Eiffel classes and then map xpaths that are relative to these elements, to attribute assigning agents.
* Supports xpath mapping based on attribute value predicates, i.e. Expressions of the form **AAA/BBB[@x='y']** may be used to map building agents.
* Supports recursive data models.

**General Xpath to Eiffel agent mapper**

The class [$source EL_CREATEABLE_FROM_XPATH_MATCH_EVENTS] implements a method for scanning a document and triggering various Eiffel agents according to a table of xpath to agent mappings.

**Eiffel Aware Document Scanner**

The class [$source EL_SMART_BUILDABLE_FROM_NODE_SCAN] is an XML parser that reacts to a special XML processing instruction, telling it to build an Eiffel object of a particular type.
