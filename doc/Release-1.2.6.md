Eiffel-Loop (1.2.6) released 17th August 2015

* Renamed classes in heirarchy named `EL_FORMATTED`. The new names are as follows.

```` c
EL_FORMATTED_TEXT_BLOCK
  EL_FORMATTED_TEXT_HEADER
  EL_FORMATTED_MONOSPACE_TEXT
  EL_FORMATTED_NUMBERED_PARAGRAPHS
````

* Simplified code in `EL_FORMATTED_TEXT_BLOCK` and `{EL_HTML_TEXT}.on_html_end`
Removed routine `{EL_FORMATTED_TEXT_BLOCK}.add_to_rich_text`

* Changes to `EL_BUILD_INFO`
Moved all version functions into new class `EL_SOFTWARE_VERSION` that includes maintenance version number and build.
`{EL_SOFTWARE_VERSION}.out` maps to old `{EL_BUILD_INFO}.version_string`
`{EL_SOFTWARE_VERSION}.string` maps to old `{EL_BUILD_INFO}.short_version_string`
Merged  major_version, minor_version and maintenance_version in `BUILD_INFO` descendant into single version
number of type `NATURAL`. This number is auto generated by scons build.

```` eiffel
version_number: NATURAL
		-- version in form jj_nn_tt where: jj is major version, nn is minor 
		-- version and tt is maintenance version 
		-- padded with leading zeros: eg. 01_02_15 is Version 1.2.15
	deferred
	end
````
* Build system in python-support
In the scons build system the version number in project.py should now be specified as a triplet
```` python
version = (1, 2, 3)
````

* Changed `{EL_STORABLE_CHAIN}.version` from type `REAL` to type `NATURAL` to reflect changes to `EL_BUILD_INFO`. Also changed `{EL_MEMORY_READER_WRITER}.data_version` to type `NATURAL`

* class `EL_OBJECT_FACTORY` now raises Eiffel runtime panic exceptions if it fails to instantiate class.

* Made `EL_PARSER` more compatible with `EL_ASTRING` by introducing class `EL_ASTRING_VIEW` to deal with augmented latin source text. `EL_STRING_VIEW is now assumed to be dealing with unicode.

* `{EL_FILE_PARSER}.set_source_text_from_line_source` now uses `EL_ASTRING` by default, but if there are too many foreign (augmented unicode) characters, then it switches to `STRING_32`. This was considered necessary  because in a large file it is more likely that you will overflow foreign characters.

* Changed name and types of conversion routines in `EL_ASTRING_VIEW`
to_view_general TO to_string: `EL_ASTRING`
to_view TO to_string_8
to_view_32 TO to_string_32

* Introduced new routine *to_string_general*
