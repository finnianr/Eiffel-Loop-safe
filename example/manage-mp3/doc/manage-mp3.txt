This is a full-blown MP3 collection manager that is designed to work in conjunction with the [https://wiki.gnome.org/Apps/Rhythmbox Rhythmbox media player] and has a number of features of particular interest to Tango DJs.

**Manger Syntax**

	el_rhythmbox -manager -config <task-configuration>.pyx

**Features**

* Integrates with the GNOME desktop and the [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GNOME_Terminal GNOME terminal] so you can drag and drop task configuration files on to either a [https://developer.gnome.org/integration-guide/stable/desktop-files.html.en desktop launcher] or the GNOME terminal.
* Automatically add album art to MP3 files from a directory based on album name or artist name.
* Collate songs into a directory structure according to song tags:

	<genre>/<artist-name>/<song-title>.<unique id>.mp3

* Import videos in various formats as MP3 files automatically adding ID3 tags according to folder location. Includes facility for mapping video segments to individual MP3 files.
* Replace songs marked as duplicated, updating all playlists and removing replaced song from collection.
* Display all ID3 tag comments
* Create [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cortina_(tango) tango cortinas] to act as breaks between a set of dance songs.
* Delete all ID3 tag comments except for the Rhythmbox 'c0' comment. (Gets rid of iTune identifiers etc.)
* Remove all UFID fields from ID3 tags
* Store playlists in a special format that can be easily edited in a text editor to add DJ event information.
* Publish playlists augmented with DJ event information to a website using an Evolicity HTML template.
* Display [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MusicBrainz MusicBrainz info] for any songs that have it.
* Display songs with incomplete [http://id3.org/id3v2.3.0#Declared_ID3v2_frames TXXX ID3] tags (User defined text).
* Archive songs placed in a special "Archive" playlist. This removes them from the main Rhythmbox collection but does not delete them.
* Append field "album-artist" into main 'c0' comment.
* Replace 'c0' comment with album-artist info
* Synchronize all (or selected genres) of music with connected device.
* Export all playlists and associated MP3 to external device
* Has a trick where the beats-per-minute ID3 field can be used to generate a silent pause after particular songs in a playlist.
* Writes a unique audio signature into the MusicBrainz track id to facilitate foolproof device synchronization.
